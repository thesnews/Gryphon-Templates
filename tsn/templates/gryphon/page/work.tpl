	<h1>Work at The State News</h1>

		<h3 class="box gray">Who we are</h3>

		<p>The State News is brought to you through the hard work of five departments:</p>
		
		<h4>Advertising</h4>
		
		<p>Advertising is responsible for generating $2 million annually for The State News. We're always looking for outgoing people who are self-motivated and have a strong desire to work.</p>
		
		<h4>Business Office</h4>
		
		<p>The business office provides support to all the other departments. We're also responsible for all financial matters relating to the newspaper.</p>
		
		<h4>Distribution</h4>
		
		<p>The distribution team is responsible for delivering The State News to MSU and the surrounding area.</p>
		
		<h4>Editorial</h4>
		
		<p>At its core, The State News is about just that - news. Reporters, Designers, Editors, Photographers and Interns work together to bring relevant and objective information to the MSU community.</p>
		
		<h4>Production</h4>
		
		<p>Production is vital to the creation and structure of both the daily edition and statenews.com. Without this department the paper would never make it to circulation every day.</p>
