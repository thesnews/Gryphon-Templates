		<h2>Visitors</h2>
		<p>
		Like most website operators, The State News collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. The State News's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how The State News's visitors use its website.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The State News also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. The State News does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.
		</p>
			
			
		<h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
		
		<p>
		Certain visitors to The State News's websites choose to interact with The State News in ways that require The State News to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that The State News gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who comment to an email address. In each case, The State News collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with The State News. The State News does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
